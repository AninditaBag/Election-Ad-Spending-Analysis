based on elections by any of the political parties, especially BJP and INC. All the
parties in India usually spend a lot of money on election campaigns. I used the

Facebook ads by each political party during the Indian elections 2024 in each state.
In this article, I performed elections ad spending analysis using Python and how it
impacted the voting patterns.
